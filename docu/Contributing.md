# Contributing to GitExtensions (AlexNek Fork)

This document outlines how to contribute to the GitExtensions AlexNek fork. This fork has its own development approach and may differ from the main project in architecture and features.

## Overview

Contributions are welcome! Since this is a personal fork, the contribution process is more streamlined compared to the main project. Whether it's bug fixes, new features, or improvements, follow these guidelines.

## Quick Start

1. **Report Issues**: Create issues directly in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/AlexNek/gitextensions/issues). Provide details like steps to reproduce and environment info.

2. **Contribute Code**:
   - Fork the repository at https://github.com/AlexNek/gitextensions.
   - Create a branch for your changes.
   - Follow coding standards (C# 13, async patterns, tests).
   - Submit a pull request to the fork with a clear description.

3. **Good First Issues**: Look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted" in the fork's issues.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Scope**: Keep changes focused and aligned with the fork's architecture.
- **Commits**: Use clear, atomic commits (rebase if needed).
- **Description**: Explain changes and rationale.
- **Tests**: Include unit tests for new code.
- **Style**: Match existing code style (.editorconfig).
- **Sign Off**: All submissions should follow the [Developer Certificate of Origin](contributors.txt).

Note: Unlike the main project, PRs here are reviewed more quickly as this is a personal fork.

## Development Setup

See [DeveloperGuide](DeveloperGuide.md) for building from source, testing, and plugin development.

## Translations

This fork may support multiple languages. For translation contributions, create issues or PRs directly in the fork.

## Conduct

Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a welcoming environment.
